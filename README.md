# GraphicsDemoDungeon

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

This demo is used to test animaitons and UI interactions with the enviornment.

## Story

You wake up as a ninja, lost in the desert with no memory of anything else.
You meet a man, dancing without a care in the world. He seems normal, but you see demonds
around him. He appears to be keeping them in check if he is this carefree.

You go inside the room, only to realize that the room is complete chaos. You walk into a cult,
and in the middle of the room you see that same man, only this time, he is going insane. You look
above him and see that there are more demons. He couldnt take it.


This demo is a representation of someone's mind. Someone may look normal and happy on the outside, 
but if we go inside their mind, they could be struggling with their own demons.


## How to play:

Use the WASD keys to move.
Look around by moving the mouse.
Jump by pressing the spacebar (You can double jump)
Press the `  key to toggle the mouse.
